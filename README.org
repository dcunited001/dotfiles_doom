* Doom Emacs

* Setup/Config

** Modules & Packages

** Desktop, Projectile, Workspace, Treemacs

What's the ideal way to approach this for various projects?

** Misc Config:
*** TODO setup word-wrap? and call on file save

* Ideas

** _org-trello_
*** TODO check out /org-trello/ and at least try importing cards/checklists from existing boards into org items

** Modeline
*** TODO if using _projectile_, show the current *project*
*** check out moodline

** Tool to clone/sync repos in a language sub/folder
*** TODO standardize a format for listing repos to clone for a language like clojure/julia/etc or use something like [[https://github.com/asottile/all-repos][asottile/all-repos]]

* The Important Things In Life:

** TODO treemacs-icons
